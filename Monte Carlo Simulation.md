$$\delta S = rS \delta t + \sigma S\sqrt{\delta t} \phi $$
where $\phi$ is drawn from a standardized Normal Distrubution.

Put the latest value of S into right-hand side to calculate $\delta S$ and hence the next value for S.

This discretisation method has a error of $O(\delta t)$


## Advantages of Monte Carlo Simulations
- Very basic maths to perform the simulation
- Correlations can be easily modelled 
- For better accuracy, just need more simulations 
- Complex path dependency can often be easily incorporated
